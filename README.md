## Google Sheets and Google Apps Script

The scripts not included in the google_colab folder are designed to be used within Google Sheets and Google Apps Script. Each subfolder contains scripts for specific functionalities:

- [`public_api`](public_api/readme.md): Script for fetching data from a public API and populating a Google Sheets spreadsheet.

Refer to the individual README.md files in each subfolder for more details on setup, usage, and requirements.

## Google Colab Scripts

The scripts in the [`google_colab`](google_colab) folder are designed to be used within Google Colab notebooks. These scripts perform username fuzzing and enumeration.
